# LICENSE

Since this project is dedicated to Blender scripts, and Blender is licensed 
under the GNU GPL-v3.0, I have to also use the GNU GPL-v3.0 for this project.
I apologize, I'd use pretty much any other license if I had the choice.
A copy of this license is included under the filename "COPYING.md"
